# OpenCS
Open-Source implementation of CS running on FTE QuakeWorld

# Goals
The goal of this project is to provide an open-source implementation of Counter-Strike 1.5.
Counter-Strike, being one of the most popular multiplayer games to exist, surprisingly hasn't had
a free-software implementation done until now. Meaning you could only run it on the platforms
Valve chose to support ( Microsoft Windows, MacOS X and GNU/Linux at the time of this writing )

Together we can create a foundation for people to enhance the Counter-Strike experience 
by allowing them to add new weapons, gamemodes and more!

# Compiling
1. Download the latest version of FTE QuakeWorld.
2. Download csv15full.exe and to get the cstrike folder.
3. Move both the cstrike folder and FTE QuakeWorld into a folder
4. Compile the Client and Server modules using fteqcc and put them into the cstrike folder
5. Run FTE QuakeWorld
