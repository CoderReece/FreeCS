These are only binaries for a rewritten, specific version of
Counter-Strike, the mod. It has nothing to do with the CS games of the
past 15 years.<br><br>Q: Do I have to own Half-Life to play this?<br>A:
It will run without. Hell, it can even "run" without the CS content.
But you certainly will have difficulties connecting to FreeCS servers.<br><br>Q: Why do I have to download CS 1.5 manually?<br>A: Legal reasons, cannot re-distribute them without potentially causing some trouble.<br><br>Q: Why is this not using the Half-Life engine?<br>A:
The SDK for that engine has one of the least open-source friendly
licenses ever written. Open-sourcing a Half-Life mod is actually
against the EULA of that SDK. Making it a QuakeWorld mod means I own
all the rights to it.<br><br>Q: What does FreeCS mean?<br>A: Primarily
it stands for Free Counter-Strike, as in Free-Software... it can also
mean "free" as in free beer because you don't have to pay anything to
download FreeCS itself. Some people have also speculated that it's a
political message... gotta love synonyms!<br><br>Q: Can I connect to Counter-Strike 1.5 servers with this?<br>A: No.<br><br>Q: Can I connect to (anything other than FreeCS) with this?<br>A: No.<br><br>Q: Hey, can I take redistribute this on the PlayStore and make money off of this?<br>A:
You'd be a scumbag if you did and possibly force me to adjust my
license. If you want to contribute towards a proper Android version,
contact me.<br><br>Q: What motivated you to do all this?<br>A: Good
memories, love, passion for Counter-Strike. Also as a middle finger to
anyone who told me to "do it better" when criticising the new CS game.<br><br>Q: How can I contact you for further questions?<br>A: E-Mail! Please send it to: marco at icculus dot org<br>
